This is the "Iris" dataset. Originally published at [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, [Scatter Plot](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/9e04ccfebeb84bcdc76c)). Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.

The HTML page provides the basic code required to load the data and display it on the page (as JSON) using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).

For a more up to date code example with React & D3, see (VizHub:
